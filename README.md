# Python - Variable Annotations

## Description
This project covers type annotations in Python 3, including how to specify function signatures and variable types, duck typing, and code validation with mypy.

## Resources
- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Type annotations in Python 3
- How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation
- All your classes should have a documentation
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation
- A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method
